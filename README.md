=============================================================================================
This Project has been accomplished by following the above mentioned course
it simply models the relation between a gig (party) and and artist , the logged user (Artist) may do the 

core use cases
--------------
* add a gig
* view all up coming gigs
* add a gig to calender
* follow an artist
* view gigs  I am attending
* who I am following
=============================================================================================
in this course  I have learned :
* 1-How To Extract Use Case Out of Requirements Document.

* 2-Using Asp.net Identity .
* 3-Using Authrorize Attribute
* 4-Building a Model With Code first Approach 
* 5-Using Data Annotation to Override Entity framework convention
* 6-Buidling Nice Looking Forms with Bootstrap.
* 7-Using ViewModels to provide UI Separation from Domain
* 8-Implementing Custom Validation Attributes with data annotation like : required ,range ,MaxLength,... and creating custom validation Classes
* 9-Improving User Experience Of Using Application.
* 10-Using Visual Studio / Reshaper Shortcuts for faster coding and more productivity.
* 11-Writing Cleane Code.
* 12-using foreign key properties to save round trips(extra queries) to db and load related Entitie.
* 13-Preventing  Common Web Application Vulnerabilities :
SQL Injection : solved by parameterized Query ,EF 
,Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) : MVC  Razor rejects JS as Input
,Cross Site Request Firgery(CSRF) : on behalf of user action ,solved by @Html.AntiForgeryToken(
* 14-Selecting Suitable coloring to match Application Nature.
* 15-Usability best practices .
* 16-Extending Application User Class.
* 17-Relative and Absolute Position, Zen Coding ,Css Attr.
* 18-Calling a WebApi Ajax -post with parameters and Using Dto to recieve Param.
* 19-Implement one to many, many to many relations using code first approach.
* 20- How to write a readme file on github :D .

---------------
Part 2 :
* 21- Implementing Create and Save DB Mehtod.
* 22- Implementing Update Mehtod using the same view used in Add operation.
* 23-Using Expression <Func> to get method name in run time and route too which action : add or edit.
* 24- Implementing Logical Delete : ajax -api .
* 25 - using bootbox : a js library to make bootstrap modals.
* 26- Gradually Building a Notification System to display User notification when a Gig is Changed (Upated ,Cancelled).
* 27 - Refactoing : usign Factory method if my constructor has more logic that setting Parameters 
 * 28 - Refactoring : protecting state of created object by creating a single method responsible for that ,with private setter.
 * 29 - using Dtos : when I don't want to expose all the data of my model to the client.
 * 30 - using autoMapper : a greate package to auto map map models to dtos so you don't wrie your mapping manually ,check this link as Mosh using old version of automapper ,use link to work with new version https://bit.ly/2qu8O4B.
 * 31 -Customizing WebApi to return Camel Case instead of Pascal Case as javascript loves Camels.
 * 32 - Using Bootstrap icons and badges.
 *  33 - Using Animate.css to Animate the Notification Count
 * 34 - Buidling A static PopOver
 * 35  - Customizing Popover to get it's content from Api (note for fellow developers : use popover-title and popover-content classes in pop over template not popover-header and popover-body to make the code work with you.
 * 36- Using moment.js : your best friend to parse ,manipulate and display dates in JavaScript.
 * 37- Using Less : A dynamic Style Sheet Language ,that gets compiled to css at run time (simply write  less css- a more elegant way).
 *38 - using undescore.js : among it's useful features ,here I have learbed how to use undescore.js as a templating engin which means how to format a template for popover ,that get rendered on the client(ie : fill the template with the notifications retured from the api).
 
 * 39- * Decoupling * the Application from presistant framework (Entity FrameWork) and Using *Repository (in memory collection)*,and commiting the transactions using *UnitofWork*.
 * 40- Appling the *Depedency Inversion Principle *:
  a-Higher level Modules shouldn't depend on lower level Modules ,both should depend on Abstraction : performed by making both Controller Class and Unitwork depend on IUnitOfWork.
  b-Abstraction must not depend on Details ,but Details Must depend on Abstraction : performed by removing reference of repository calss from UnitOfWork  and replacing them with Interfaces.
  41- Using Ninject  : that is a Dependecy Injection framework,I use to initialize the dependecy ( IUnitOfWork) passed to Controller 's Constructor rather than just passing a concert implementation of a class.
  42-using ninject.extensions.conventions for convention based Binding in Ninject rather than manually typing the Interface
 and it's class.
